\en-abstract{
Many large applications are now built using collections of
microservices, each of which is deployed in isolated containers 
and which interact with each other through the use
of remote procedure calls (RPCs). The use of microservices
improves scalability – each component of an application can
be scaled independently – and deployability. However, such
applications are inherently distributed and current tools do not
provide mechanisms to reason about and ensure their global
behavior.
In this project, we propose a system to verify microservices communications.
Inspired by Design by Contract, our system monitor services at runtime to detect
services that do not satisfy their contracts. Finally, we implement our system on
a real-world microservices application and we show how we found some bugs in this application
without performance loss.
